## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Local web server (recommended for development)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download** the project files to your desired directory:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd ucret-hesaplama
   ```

2. **Set up a local web server** (required for proper JSON file loading):
   
   **Option A: Python (if installed)**
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```
   
   **Option B: Node.js (if installed)**
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```
   
   **Option C: VS Code Live Server extension**
   - Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
   - Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

3. **Access the application**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown by your server)
   - The application should load with the Ko√ß University branded interface

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**"Veri y√ºklenirken hata olu≈ütu" (Data loading error)**
- **Cause**: CORS restrictions when opening the HTML file directly in browser
- **Solution**: Use a local web server as described in setup instructions
- **Fallback**: The application includes sample data for testing purposes

**Language switching not working**
- **Cause**: localStorage might be disabled in browser
- **Solution**: Enable localStorage or use private/incognito mode for testing

**Calculations seem incorrect**
- **Verify**: Check that all form fields are properly selected
- **Debug**: Open browser developer tools (F12) to see console logs

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Presentation Layer** (`index.html`): Structure and styling
2. **Logic Layer** (`assets/fees.js`): Business logic and user interactions
3. **Data Layer** (`assets/fees.json`): Core tuition data
4. **Localization Layer** (`assets/translations.json`): Translation system

### Key Technical Decisions

**Translation System**
- Implements complete i18n with parameter interpolation
- Stores language preference in localStorage
- Supports dynamic UI updates without page reload

**Discount Calculation**
- 4-tier discount system: LYS ‚Üí General Waivers ‚Üí Sibling ‚Üí Final calculation
- JavaScript-based calculations for flexibility
- Separate discount logic from base data

**Error Handling**
- Graceful fallback to sample data when JSON files are unavailable
- User-friendly error messages in both languages
- Console logging for development debugging

**UI/UX Enhancements**
- Removed form labels for cleaner interface
- Integrated titles into dropdown placeholders
- Language switcher positioned next to step counter
- Legal disclaimer for informational use protection

### Data Flow

1. **Application Initialization**:
   - Load saved language preference
   - Fetch translation files
   - Load tuition data (with fallback)
   - Populate form dropdowns
   - Set up event listeners

2. **User Interaction**:
   - Validate form inputs
   - Update dependent dropdowns
   - Handle special cases (LYS scholarship visibility)
   - Navigate between steps

3. **Calculation Process**:
   - Match user selections to data records
   - Apply discount calculations in sequence
   - Generate detailed results breakdown
   - Display formatted output

## üîí Legal and Compliance

The application includes a legal disclaimer stating that the tool is for informational purposes only. Users should verify all calculations with official university sources before making financial decisions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development and Maintenance

### Code Organization

The JavaScript code is thoroughly documented with:
- **Header comments** explaining overall architecture
- **Function-level documentation** with parameters and return values
- **Inline comments** explaining complex logic
- **Section dividers** for easy navigation

### Extending the Application

**Adding New Academic Years**:
1. Update `assets/fees.json` with new year data
2. No code changes required (automatically populated)

**Adding New Languages**:
1. Extend `assets/translations.json` with new language object
2. Update language switching logic in `assets/fees.js`
3. Add language option to UI

**Modifying Discount Logic**:
1. Update calculation functions in `assets/fees.js`
2. Ensure translations cover any new UI elements
3. Test with various scenarios

### Performance Considerations

- **Data Loading**: Single JSON file load with client-side filtering
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient data structures and minimal DOM manipulation
- **Network Requests**: Minimal external dependencies, local asset loading

## üìû Support and Troubleshooting

For technical issues or questions:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Open Developer Tools (F12) for error messages
2. **Verify Setup**: Ensure local web server is running properly
3. **Test Fallback**: Application should work with sample data even if JSON files fail
4. **Clear Cache**: Try clearing browser cache and localStorage
